# MauiArcGISMVVM

A .NET MAUI application that demonstrates MVVM patterns in an ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET application.

This app is featured in an [ArcGIS blog post](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/sdk-net/developers/using-arcgis-maps-sdk-for-net-in-an-mvvm-pattern/) which gives more details and background on MVVM, along with context of how the app was built
